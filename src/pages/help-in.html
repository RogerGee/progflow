        <h1>Input Blocks</h1>

        <p>
            A computer program wouldn't be very useful if it couldn't read user
            input. <i>Input blocks</i> allow you to prompt the user for an input
            value and assign those values to variables. Input blocks use <a
            href="help-formatstr.html">format strings</a> to specify the input
            operation (just like <a href="help-out.html">output blocks</a>).
            When a variable is specified in a format string, the input block
            requests input from the terminal emulator at the bottom of the
            screen. The user then enters input and the block assigns it to the
            specified variable(s).
        </p>

        <p>
            Non-variable text of the input block's format string will be printed
            up until a variable is specified. This is true for each variable in
            the format string. For example, the following format string will
            print <code>Enter number:&nbsp;</code> and then read input that will
            be assigned to variable <code>a</code>.
        </p>

        <code class="page-indent">
            Enter number: %a
        </code>

        <p>This produces the following (given input 5):</p>

        <div class="page-indent output">
            Enter number: <span class="input">5</span><br>
        </div>

        <p>Here's a more complicated format string example:</p>

        <code class="page-indent">
            Enter %a and then %b.
        </code>

        <p>This produces the following (given input 5 and 8):</p>

        <div class="page-indent output">
            Enter <span class="input">5</span><br>
            and then <span class="input">8</span><br>
            .
        </div>

        <p>
            It is generally not a good idea to have part of the output prompt
            after a variable in an input block format string. As you can see,
            the user entering a line makes the message span multiple lines.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, there are a couple of things to know about how input is
            read and processed by the block:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Every line of input is split up into whitespace-separated
                tokens. The block then converts each token into a number and
                assigns it to a variable. Since you can specify more than one
                variable in a format string, the block can assign multiple
                values from one line of input. If the user didn't supply enough
                input on a line, another line is requested (and so on until all
                of the required input has been read).
            </li>
            <li>
                Extra tokens read by the block are not available to future
                blocks. In other words, each line of input is available only to
                the block that requested it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Simulator only operates on numbers; therefore the user
                should not enter any non-numeric input string. If they do, the
                Simulator will fail and stop execution.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an empty line is read, the block will do nothing and request
                another line.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
