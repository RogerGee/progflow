        <h1>Variables</h1>

        <p>
            Variables are symbolic placeholders for data used in the computer
            program. Every variable has a unique name that must begin with a letter
            (either upper or lower case) or underscore <code>_</code>. Any
            subsequent combination of letters, underscores or digits is allowed.
        </p>

        <p>
            A variable is created when it is first assigned a value. Variables
            only store numbers and cannot be used to hold onto Boolean values,
            text strings or any other kind of data.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to its name and value, a variable also has a property
            called <i>scope</i>. Scope is the part of the computer program in
            which the variable is valid (i.e. defined). Another useful term
            associated with scope is <i>lifetime</i>. The lifetime of a variable
            is how long the variable exists in the program's execution. This is
            similar but different from scope which describes the "space" in
            which a variable is defined. In the Simulator, a variable exists
            throughout its scope (meaning the variable's scope and lifetime
            describe the same thing). When a variable is created, it exists in
            the scope in which it was created. Once a variable's scope ends, the
            variable is destroyed and becomes unavailable to the program.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Simulator will keep a variable "in-scope" for as long as the
            <i>block</i> that defined the variable is executing. As such, each
            block effectively creates its own scope. A block is a region of
            statements in the program. Types of blocks defined by the Simulator
            include <a href="help-proc.html">procedures</a>, a
            <a href="help-while.html">loop</a> body or the true/false part of an
            <a href="help-if.html">if-statement</a>. The Simulator draws a
            dashed line around blocks in program.
        </p>

        <p>
            What's confusing about scope is that some scopes may overlap (i.e.
            one scope is nested within another). The scope that contains the
            other is called the wider scope or overlapping scope. Likewise the
            nested scope is called the narrower or overlapped scope. All
            variables defined in the wider scope are available to the narrower
            scope given that they were already defined before the narrower scope
            was reached. However this doesn't work both ways. Since the narrower
            scope ends before the wider scope, its variables are destroyed
            before the wider scope could access them. Make sure that variables
            are first referenced in the widest possible scope so that they can
            be accessed where needed. Sometimes you may just need to assign a
            dummy value to create a variable needed at a wider scope.
