        <h1>Output Blocks</h1>

        <p>
            Output blocks allow the program to write output to the terminal
            emulator at the bottom of the screen. Output blocks use <a
            href="help-formatstr.html">format strings</a> to  specify how output
            is written to the terminal screen. Any format string
            variables/expressions are substituted with their evaluation into the
            resulting output. As such, variables are never modified by an output
            block.
        </p>

        <p>
            If a variable doesn't exist or an expression is incorrect, the
            Simulator will display a warning and the output block will print
            <code>'?'</code> in place of the value. As such, an output block
            will never fail.
        </p>

        <p>
            The output block allows you to either print or omit a trailing
            <i>newline</i>. A newline is a whitespace character that creates a
            line separation in the output. By default, an output block will
            include a trailing newline. Omitting the newline is useful if you
            want to allow multiple output blocks to write to the same line.
