progflow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a Web application that provides a program flow simulator. The
application is designed to be run entirely in the browser. The simulator uses a
subset of the C++ language as an interface for flow diagrams produced using the
software.

installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install, recursively copy everything under src/ to a Web server. Users may
then pull down the software by visiting your Web site. The Web browser should
cache the application so that only newer versions are pulled down when visiting
the site.
